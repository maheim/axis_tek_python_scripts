## Python Scripts

Hey everyone, my name is Matt and here are some of my Python scripts I created at my previous job at a startup. I've gotten permission from one of my superiors to put this on GitHub, and I've went ahead and removed any references to proprietary material, such as names and paths. I've replaced every occurrence with something in accents ("<", ">") - for example, `<removed>`, `<path>`, `<domain>`, etc.

**Please do not expect these scripts to work!** They are meant for reading/reference and to showcase a portion of my previous work. These scripts also rely on proprietary tools as well as logfile outputs from those tools, so it would be difficult to get them to run. That being said, there are a lot of ideas here that can be applied to new Python scripts.
